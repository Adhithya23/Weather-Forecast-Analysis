# Weather-Forecast-Analysis


### Introduction
This project is a Python-based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts by providing a tailored weather forecast. It fetches live weather data, analyzes it to determine farming suitability, and saves a 5-day forecast to a user-friendly Excel file for easy access and record-keeping.

### Features
* **Weather Data Integration:** Connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to get up-to-date weather forecasts for any city or village worldwide.
* **Farming Suitability Analysis:** Evaluates daily weather conditions, specifically temperature and rainfall, to provide actionable advice on whether the day is suitable for farming activities.
* **Data Export:** Automatically organizes the forecast data into a clean, well-structured Excel file (`.xlsx`) for offline use.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts the user to input a location name, making the application simple and easy to use.

### Technologies Used
* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Requests:** A library used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
* **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library used to handle dataframes and export them to Excel.
* **OpenWeatherMap API:** The external service that provides the weather data.

### Setup and Installation

#### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.

#### 2. Get an API Key
The application requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
1.  Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and create a free account.
2.  Navigate to the **API keys** tab to find your personal key.

#### 3. Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install requests pandas
```
### Usage
1. Open the `main.py` file in a text editor.

2. Find the line `api_key = ""` and replace the empty quotes with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. Save the file and run the script from your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
4. When prompted, enter the name of the city or village you want the forecast for.

The script will display the weather forecast in the terminal and save an Excel file named `[Your_City]_weather_forecast.xlsx` in the same directory.

### File Structure
`main.py`: The core Python script for the application.

`[city]_weather_forecast.xlsx`: The output file generated by the script containing the weather data.
